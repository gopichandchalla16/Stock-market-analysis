 Stock Market Analysis

This repository contains a stock market analysis project using Python. The project leverages historical stock data for companies like Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) to explore and visualize relationships between stock prices, calculate key financial metrics, and assess potential risks. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the project generates possible future price paths based on historical returns and volatility, helping us understand price fluctuation and calculate Value at Risk (VaR). 

Visualization tools like scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots provide insights into the relationships between stock returns, showing trends, correlations, and variances across different stocks. This analysis offers a valuable foundation for understanding stock market behavior, making informed investment decisions, and expanding into more advanced financial modeling. 

 Features
- Data loading and cleaning for stock price history
- Monte Carlo simulations for predicting future stock prices
- Risk assessment with Value at Risk (VaR)
- Visualization of price distributions and pairwise relationships between stocks

 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`

 Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore stock price analysis and Monte Carlo simulations.
